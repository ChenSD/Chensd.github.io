# 词汇

1. 递进关系词汇(表示"还, 进而, 此外"): Furthermore, Moreover, Besides
   * 首先, 在句子或段落之间递进时, 注意要用furthermore, 而不是further.
   * 递进关系: 先是Furthermore, 再是Moreover, 最后是Besides.
2. 同级关系(表示"同样","一样地") Also, And, and Too.
And connects directly, also slightly less directly, and too tends to have more commas.
    * I like green and blue. 	
	* I like green. I also like blue.
	* I like green. I like blue, too.

3. Congruence，一致性。Congruence是“一致性”的比较书面的表达，它最接近的单词是consistency。比如我们说，历史惊人的一致性。这时候用The amazing historical congruence是非常恰当的。和consistency相比，Congruence更指不同的事物之间的一致性，而consistency有明显的单一事物前后一致的意思。
    * The results show quite good congruence with recent studies. 结果显示了和最近研究发现很好的一致性。

4. Coherence，连贯性，一致性。Emotion/Affect coherence，情绪一致性。[情绪成分一致性的研究](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/psych425/chapter/emotion-coherence/) 中用Emotion Coherence来描述同一种情绪不同成分（exprience，behavior，and physiological respoinses）之间的一致性，发现悲伤情绪的不同成分之间存在变化趋势的一致性，而快乐情绪的不同成分之间则没有出现一致性变化趋势。
    * Within-system coherence，同一情绪的不同成分之间的一致性
    * Between-system coherence，不同情绪之间的一致性
    * Event-response coherence，事件/刺激与情绪反应之间的一致性
    * Bonanno, G., & Keltner, D. (2004). Brief Report The coherence of emotion systems: Comparing “on‐line” measures of appraisal and facial expressions, and self‐report. Cognition and Emotion, 18(3), 431-444.
5. Seeking and avoidance are of a higher evolutionary and developmental order than approach and withdrawal, and these terms should not be mismated” (Schneirla 1959, p. 298).

## 原则-精简

1. 例如, we need to adopt XX method to improve XXX. need to do 就是典型的中式英语, 精简掉不影响语义


## 论证

1. Furthermore, evidence suggests that implicit and explicit processing may have distinct neural substrates, with amygdala and subcortical limbic activity important for
the implicit process and the response of the prefrontal cortex for the explicit process (Critchley et al., 2000; Xiao et al., 2016)
2. Binge drinking is associated with poor academic behaviors and performance.
3. Positive impressions of potential dating partners were strongly associated with greater romantic interest
4. We review evidence from five methodological domains in cognitive neuroscience: neuropsychological lesion evidence, univariate activation studies, multivoxel pattern analyses, functional connectivity studies, and brain stimulation experiments.
5. Personality is hierarchical in structure  (McAdams & Pals, 2006; McCrae & Costa, 2008; Rushton, Bons, & Hur, 2008). Higher order domains are composed of lower order traits
6. Heterogeneity within the frontoparietal control network. The present study aimed to dissociate the role of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) from the other PPC regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional connectivity
6. It must be emphasized that although the nucleus has two parts these are not necessarily
homologous . All these receptors have a homologous structure and are put together to form a super-family
7. The strong association between early fusiform activity and RT in the explicit task
provides additional evidence for the involvement of the fusiform gyrus in processing emotional information.
8. Noteworthy, the regression analysis revealed that the more efficient participants in the visual search showed stronger FC between the SPL and areas of primary visual cortex (V1) related to the search task.
9. Neuropsychology is one field that holds promise in the construction of comprehensive, developmental models for the promotion of social competence （促进好的） and prevention of problem behavior （避免坏的）.
10. No single theory identifies all factors that predispose adolescent sexual risk behavior (Zimmer-Gembeck, &
Helfand, 2008) but identified factors in late adolescents include initiation or increase in sexual activity, inexperience with emotional relationships, and deficits in sexualrisk knowledge (Arnett, 2014; Daugherty & Copen, 2016).
11. Self-affirmation manipulations have been shown to lead to less biased processing and closed mindedness when reading counterattitudinal information (Cohen, Aronson, & Steele, 2000), to induce people to engage in more systematic processing (Correll, Spencer, & Zanna, 2004), to reduce defensive processing of potentially self-threatening health-risk messages (Harris &
Napper, 2005; Sherman & Cohen, 2002; van Koningsbruggen & Das, 2009) and to promote health-beneficial behaviours (Epton & Harris, 2008; Jessop, Simmonds, & Sparks, 2009; Sherman, Nelson, & Steele, 2000).

### Question

1. Here, we used a hypothesis-driven approach together with graph theoretical analyses to examine the possibility that the fine-grained
internal organization of the FPCN may be driven by specific connectional patterns as part of a “distance from sensorimotor
processing” principle that defines global brain organization (14–17).
2. However, this distinction is not clear-cut. A given strategy may be more or less functional depending on the situation.
3. Although it is not straightforward to differentiate adaptive from maladaptive ER strategies, previous research has identified specific strategies that are less likely to effectively regulate affect and yet more likely to incur additional costs, such as heightened physiological arousal and cognitive demand (Gross & John, 2003; Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012).



## 方法

1. Participants completed eight practice trials using
images not shown in the actual task to confirm understanding of task instructions.   

## 结果

1. 弱结果. We also
found weaker evidence for some activation of right auditory
cortex in both studies, congruent with results from previous
simpler music imagery tasks.
2. across的用法。In Experiment 1, participants used reappraisal to enhance and decrease the personal
relevance of unpleasant and neutral pictures. In Experiment 2, decrease cues were replaced with suppress
cues that directed participants to inhibit emotion-expressive behavior. Across experiments, using reappraisal to enhance the personal relevance of pictures improved free recall. By contrast, attempting to suppress emotional displays tended to impair recall, especially compared to the enhance condition.
